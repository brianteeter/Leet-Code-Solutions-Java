# Leet-Code-Solutions-Java

The purpose of this repo is to have a nice place where I can work on and share solutions to LeetCode problems using Java and Java tooling.  

LeetCode has 'taken over the world' of coding problems, and because of that employers place an inordinante amount of importance on the ability of developers to solve these coding puzzles.  So, since that's a thing now, I'm going to solve some of them and share here.  

I feel like LeetCode is not a terribly useful measure of a developer's ability.  But since it seems industry thinkis its important, and its a fun hobby anyway, so I am going to work through a bunch of them.

## Languages Used

These are solved using Java, with JUnit for testing and maven for packaging/dependencies.

I have another repo with solutions for problems in JavaScript located here:  https://github.com/brianteeter/Leet-Code-Solutions-JavaScript




## How to Use

- Make sure you have Java 21 installed
- Clone this project
- Run: `mvn clean install` which will build and run tests

I've checked in the IDEA / IntelliJ files for this as well so if you use those tools it should open and run as needed.


## Why?

LeetCode is neat and their interface is decent, but I like using a real IDE to write software.  So I do, then I copy it up to LeetCode and submit.  

Also, maybe if I make this public someone can benefit from sharing these solutions.
